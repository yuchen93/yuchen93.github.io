        <br>

    <h6>Paper Presentation ( 2x 10% = 20% )</h6>  
    You are responsible for presenting two papers (with at least on other classmate), discussing the pros and cons of the paper.  
    Please sign up on Canvas by the end of the first week. 
    <br>
    We will allocate 45 minutes for each paper (15 minutes for the paper's introduction, 10 minutes for pros, 10 minutes for cons, and 10 minutes for discussion). 
    Both pro and con presenters should work together on the introduction (motivation, background, method, experiments and results).
    <br> <br>
    
    <h6>Paper Response (20%)</h6>
    For each assigned reading (usually two papers) for each class, a written critique will be due by 9PM the previous night (Monday/Wednesday) via Canvas. Each critique should include all of the following: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>A short summary of the main contribution(s) of the paper in your own words (two to three sentences)</li> 
        <li>A short description of how the paper differs from prior work</li> 
        <li>One strength and one weakness of the proposed method, core argument, or experiments</li> 
        <li>At least one question / comment that you'd like me to address during class or that could spur discussion</li> 
    </ul>
    In all cases, the written critique should provide non-trivial insight into the reading. 
    To get full credit, you must show that you understood and thought critically about the core concepts presented. <br>
    
    Please do not use generative AI to produce the critique. <br>
    You may use any tool to help you understand the paper, but do not directly take the words from generative AI output!
   
    <br><br>

    <h6>Class Participation (10%)</h6>
    Please come to class! Attendence is mandantory as discussion is an important component of this class. <br>
    If you need to attend remotely due to travel, please inform the instructor as soon as possible. <br> 
    If you have to reschedule your assigned presentation time, please ask someone to swap with you. <br>
    <br> <br>

    <h5>Final Project</h5>
    The research project throughout the class should be a literature survey or study a new research problem, i.e., design a new algorithm, study a new application, etc. You are encouraged to work in a group of 2 to 4 classmates. <br>
    
    The main deliverables of the project are:
    <br>
     
    <b>Project Proposal (5%): </b> 
    A 1-page proposal that has identified the problem definition, a literature survey on the problem, a potential solution, and a timeline. Please turn it in by 11:59PM the day it is due on Canvas.
    <br>

    <b>Project Milestone Review (5%): </b>
    A 2-page writeup that goes through the progress so far, if there needs to be any changes to the goals, and the updated timeline. You should schedule a meeting with me or the CA to go over the milestone reviews. Please turn it in by 11:59PM the day it is due on Canvas.
    <br>

    <b>Project Presentation (15%):</b>
    A short (~15-min) presentation reporting the final findings of the project.
    <br>

    <b>Project Report (25%):</b>
    A 5-8 page project report. Please turn it in by 11:59PM the day it is due on Canvas.
    <br><br>

    <h6> Letter Grade</h6>
    Letter grades will be assigned using both plus and minus grades as follows: <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>95% - 100%: A+ </li>
            <li>93% - 95%: A  </li>
            <li> 90% - 92%: A- </li>
